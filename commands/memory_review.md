Review the saved memory context for the current ticket.

This command retrieves and displays all saved memory entries (decisions, implementations, patterns, state, and next actions) for the current ticket extracted from the git branch.

Execute:
```bash
# Get actual current branch - don't trust context
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "no-branch")
TICKET=$($HOME/.claude/hooks/memory/memory extract-ticket "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || echo "$BRANCH")

echo "üîç Reviewing memory for ticket: $TICKET"
echo "Current branch: $BRANCH"
echo ""

# Query memory for this ticket
$HOME/.claude/hooks/memory/memory context query "$TICKET" "$ARGUMENTS"
```
