Review all staged and unstaged changes on this branch (not pushed yet). Be brutally honest.

1. Do these changes actually do what they're supposed to? 
2. Will they cause regressions? Check for breaking changes, performance hits, lost functionality, new bugs, missing tests.

Spawn sub-agents to check in parallel:
- Agent 1: Logic correctness & implementation quality
- Agent 2: Regression analysis & backwards compatibility  
- Agent 3: Testing, edge cases & bugs

Be specific. Point out exactly what's wrong and where. No padding.
