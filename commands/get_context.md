description: Load CONTEXT.md from current directory

Look for CONTEXT.md in the current directory only. If found, read it and confirm you've loaded it into memory. If not found, report that it doesn't exist in the current directory. Do not search other directories, create plans, write code, or take any actions beyond reading the file.
