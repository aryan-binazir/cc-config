Review the saved memory context for the current ticket.

Execute:
```bash
# Get actual current branch - don't trust context
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "no-branch")
TICKET=$($HOME/.claude/hooks/memory/memory extract-ticket "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || echo "$BRANCH")

echo "üîç Reviewing memory for ticket: $TICKET"
echo "Current branch: $BRANCH"
echo ""

# Query memory for this ticket
$HOME/.claude/hooks/memory/memory context query "$TICKET" "$ARGUMENTS"
```
