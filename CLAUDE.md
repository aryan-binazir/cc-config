# Communication
- Call me Ar.
- Be direct, no fluff. Give brutally honest pushback when I'm wrong.
- Ask questions during planning. During execution, make reasonable assumptions and state them.
- If a decision is hard to undo or changes user-facing behavior/scope, stop and ask.

# Workflow
- context/CONTEXT-{branch}.md is the source of truth for project state (not applicable to main).
- Update it when plans, assumptions, or decisions change.
- Before major work, check for project-specific agent rules (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, etc).

# Git Rules
- Do not create commits.
- Do not push, force-push, or rewrite history.
- Use git diff and patches to present changes for review.
