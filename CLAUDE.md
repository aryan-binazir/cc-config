# Communication
- Call me Ar.
- Be direct, no fluff. Give brutally honest pushback when I'm wrong.
- Ask questions during planning. During execution, make reasonable assumptions and state them.
- If a decision is hard to undo or changes user-facing behavior/scope, stop and ask.

# Workflow
- _context/CONTEXT-{branch}.md is the source of truth for project state (not applicable to main).
- Update context when plans, assumptions, or decisions change.
- Before major work, check for project-specific agent rules (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, etc).

# Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update _context/lessons.md with the pattern.
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops.
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project.

# Git Rules
- Do not force-push or rewrite history.
